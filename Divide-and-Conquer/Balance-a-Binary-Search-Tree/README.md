Given the `root` of a binary search tree, return _a **balanced** binary search tree with the same node values_. If there is more than one answer, return **any of them**.

A binary search tree is **balanced** if the depth of the two subtrees of every node never differs by more than `1`.

 

**Example 1:**

```
Input: root = [1,null,2,null,3,null,4,null,null]
Output: [2,1,3,null,null,null,4]
Explanation: This is not the only correct answer, [3,1,4,null,2] is also correct.
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: root = [2,1,3]
Output: [2,1,3]
```

 

**Constraints:**

	- The number of nodes in the tree is in the range `[1, 104]`.

	- `1 <= Node.val <= 105`
