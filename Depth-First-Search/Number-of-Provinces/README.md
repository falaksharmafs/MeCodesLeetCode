There are `n` cities. Some of them are connected, while some are not. If city `a` is connected directly with city `b`, and city `b` is connected directly with city `c`, then city `a` is connected indirectly with city `c`.

A **province** is a group of directly or indirectly connected cities and no other cities outside of the group.

You are given an `n x n` matrix `isConnected` where `isConnected[i][j] = 1` if the `ith` city and the `jth` city are directly connected, and `isConnected[i][j] = 0` otherwise.

Return _the total number of **provinces**_.

 

**Example 1:**

```
Input: isConnected = [[1,1,0],[1,1,0],[0,0,1]]
Output: 2
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: isConnected = [[1,0,0],[0,1,0],[0,0,1]]
Output: 3
```

 

**Constraints:**

	- `1 <= n <= 200`

	- `n == isConnected.length`

	- `n == isConnected[i].length`

	- `isConnected[i][j]` is `1` or `0`.

	- `isConnected[i][i] == 1`

	- `isConnected[i][j] == isConnected[j][i]`
